As my grandmother liked to say, debate requires us to take a step back and recognize that God gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason. I wish us all the courage to listen to one another, because as C.S.

Notre Dame has a storied role in the development of American conservatism’s first principles. I hold those principles dear and, as I will discuss today, our enforcement of the antitrust laws will reflect those principles. Indeed, we seek to bring these shared principles to our work every day: they include American patriotism; textualism and adherence to precedent; and a firm commitment to law enforcement.",
