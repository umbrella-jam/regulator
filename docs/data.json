Of course, much like debate in general, debate about competition policy takes courage. As my grandmother liked to say, debate requires us to take a step back and recognize that God gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason. I wish us all the courage to listen to one another, because as C.S. Lewis wrote in the Screwtape Letters, “Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the first of every virtue at the testing point.”",

I’ve had many offers to speak since I began my tenure at the Department of Justice, but it seemed appropriate that I present the conservative case for vigorous antitrust enforcement here at Notre Dame Law School. Notre Dame has a storied role in the development of American conservatism’s first principles. I hold those principles dear and, as I will discuss today, our enforcement of the antitrust laws will reflect those principles. Indeed, we seek to bring these shared principles to our work every day: they include American patriotism; textualism and adherence to precedent; and a firm commitment to law enforcement.",
